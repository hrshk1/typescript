used to generate tsconfig.json 
TypeScript is flexible. Without a configuration file, the compiler doesn't know how strict you want to be. The tsconfig.json allows you to set the "strictness" of your code.
Example: Do you want to allow variables to have an any type? Or should the compiler throw an error if you forget to define a type?

//to run the ts file first uncomment 
"rootDir": "./src",
"outDir": "./dist",
this in the tsconfig.json file to make sure that the output is generated in the dist folder only
npx tsc --> write this to generate output in dist. gives d.ts, .js, .js.map, d.ts.map files as output
to run this output write node dist/index.js

set the package.json to write the script
